      <p>Last updated: [Date]</p>
      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      <p>Welcome to Chakra Medical ("Company", "we", "our", "us")! These Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") govern your use of our website located at [Website URL] (together or individually "Service") operated by Chakra Medical.</p>
      <p>Our Privacy Policy also governs your use of our Service and explains how we collect, safeguard and disclose information that results from your use of our web pages.</p>
      <p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and our Privacy Policy ("Agreements"). You acknowledge that you have read and understood Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.</p>
      <h3>2. Communications</h3>
      <p>By using our Service, you agree to subscribe to newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information we may send. However, you may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or by emailing at [Your Email Address].</p>
      <h3>3. Purchases</h3>
      <p>If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through Service ("Purchase"), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including but not limited to, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, your billing address, and your shipping information.</p>
      <p>You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct and complete.</p>
      <h3>4. Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions</h3>
      <p>Any contests, sweepstakes or other promotions (collectively, "Promotions") made available through Service may be governed by rules that are separate from these Terms of Service. If you participate in any Promotions, please review the applicable rules as well as our Privacy Policy. If the rules for a Promotion conflict with these Terms of Service, Promotion rules will apply.</p>
      <h3>5. Subscriptions</h3>
      <p>Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>
      <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Chakra Medical cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Chakra Medical customer support team.</p>
      <h3>6. Fee Changes</h3>
      <p>Chakra Medical, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
      <p>Chakra Medical will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
      <p>Your continued use of Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
